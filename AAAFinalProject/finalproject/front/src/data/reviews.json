    "review": "I took the online intensive course during the lockdown period and I just couldn’t get enough of it.  Classes were always challenging but not to the point of frustrating. Teachers were always friendly but they wouldn’t let you off the hook (of the homework) that easily either. Classmates came and went but classrooms were always conducive to learning and lots of fun. All course material was handed out electronically and zoom conference call was always top notch.",
